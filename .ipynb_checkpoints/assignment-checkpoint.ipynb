    "          * Python has very large community support as it becomes very popular programming language.\n",
    "          * Easy to debug\n",
    "          * Python is a portable programming language.we can run the same code with very few changes on any operating system like window,mac and linux etc.\n",
    "          * Python also support GUI (Graphical User Interface) so we can make GUI with the use of python modeule like PyQt5.\n",
